# OSPool service transition for ap20-21

The Open Science Pool (OSPool) is migrating certain OSPool and OSDF services to new physical / institutional locations. This transition is part of a larger service migration that will streamline and simplify how we run our services, positioning ourselves for long-term sustainability. 

**If your account is on Access Points ap20 or ap21** **(with the suffix `uc.osg-htc.org`)** you will be moving to a new Access Point in early December. Please read below for the migration timeline, downtime dates, and post-transition steps.

> **If your account is on [ap40.uw.osg-htc.org](http://ap40.uw.osg-htc.org)** or otherwise not on ap20 \- ap21 there will be no changes to your account. 


> **If you have accounts on both ap40 and ap20 or ap21**, there will be no changes to your ap40 account; contact [support@osg-htc.org](mailto:support@osg-htc.org) to coordinate consolidating your account information. 


> **Some groups on [ap23.uc.osg-htc.org](http://ap23.uc.osg-htc.org)** will be migrating to new Access Points; others may not. If you have not yet received an email about a migration process, you do not need to follow any steps in this guide. 

## Migration timeline

* **November 30, 2025:** We recommend submitting jobs to ap20-21 no later than this date.  
* **December 8, 2025:** You may test login to the new Access Points. You will not be able to submit jobs.  
* **December 8-15, 2025:** ap20-21 will be shut down during these dates.   
    * **December 8, 2025:** Job submission is disabled on ap20-21.  
    * **December 11, 2025:** Logins to ap20–21 are disabled; all remaining jobs are put on hold.   
    * **December 11-15, 2025:** All ap20-21 data will be synced to a temporary location (`/migrated`).  
* **December 15, 2025:** You can submit jobs from the new Access Points.  
    * You should copy your data (`/migrated`) to new `/home` and `/ospool/data` locations.  
* **December 15 \- January 22, 2026:** We will have dedicated office hours for helping users with the migration.   
* **May 2026:** Access to `/migrated` data will be turned off. 

## What to expect

* You will be **unable to submit and run jobs** on the OSPool between Dec. 8-15.   
* You may log into your new Access Point **after Dec. 8**.  
* You may submit jobs on the new Access Points **after Dec. 15**.  
* What happens to your data:  
    * We will copy all user data from ap20, 21 (`/home`, `/ospool`) to a temporary **`/migrated`** directory.  
    * After Dec 15, **you are responsible for copying any data you want to keep** from `/migrated` into your new `/home` or `/ospool` directories.  
    * Your data in `/migrated` will remain available **until May 2026**.

## What you should do

### 1\. General preparation (November)

* **If you are concerned about interrupted work** during the downtime period (Dec 8-15), please contact OSG staff (support@osg-htc.org) **immediately** to make alternative arrangements.   
* Go through both your `/home` and `/ospool/ap2*/data` spaces and **remove files that are no longer needed for your current work.** 

### 2\. Pre-migration window (Dec 1 \- 8\)

* **Download or back up** any critical data you may need access to during the downtime (Dec. 8-15).  
* **Avoid submitting new jobs and remove idle jobs** that are unlikely to complete by Dec 8. This will allow for cleaner data migration. 

### 3\. Migration process (Dec 8 onward)

More instructions will be added once we are closer to the migration dates. 

## Why are we doing the migration? 

* **Unified management:** Closer integration between different components of the OSPool/OSDF services ecosystem.  
* **Long-term sustainability:** As PATh (https://path-cc.io/) enters its 6th year, we are trying to simplify how we administer OSPool/OSDF services to make them more sustainable.
