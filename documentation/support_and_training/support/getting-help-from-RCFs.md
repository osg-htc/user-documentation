Email, Office Hours, and 1-1 Meetings 
====================================

*There are multiple ways to get help from OSG’s Research Computing Facilitators. Get in touch anytime!*

To help researchers effectively utilize large-scale computing, our Research Computing 
Facilitators (RCFs) are here to answer questions and provide guidance and support. 
If we're not able to help with a specific problem, we will 
do our best to connect you with another group or service that can. 

We don’t expect that you should be able to address all of your questions by consulting our [documentation](https://portal.osg-htc.org/documentation/), searching online, or just working through things on your own. Please utilize the methods below if you are stuck or have questions.

## Help via Email
We provide ongoing support via email to support@osg-htc.org. You can typically expect a first response within a few business hours.

## Virtual Office Hours
Drop-in for live help:

- Tuesdays, 4-5:30pm ET / 1-2:30pm PT
- Thursdays, 11:30am-1pm ET / 8:30-10am PT

You can find the URL to the Virtual Office Hours meeting room in the welcome message when you log into an OSG-managed Access Point, or in the signature of a support email from an RCF. 

Click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3K78Xx1Vo-KjqW_2y0YKcUMXrEsKXWk3I1Aww64RL22QpnQ/viewform) to sign-in for office hours, once you arrive in the room. 

Cancellations will be announced via email. If the times above don’t work for you, please email us at our usual support address to schedule a separate meeting.


## Make an Appointment
We are happy to arrange meetings outside of designated Office Hours. Email us to schedule a time to meet!


## Training Opportunities
The RCF team runs regular new user training on the first Tuesday of the month and a special topic training on the third Tuesday of the month. See upcoming training dates, registration information, and materials on the [OSPool Training page](../../../support_and_training/training/osgusertraining/).
