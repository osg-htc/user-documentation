Roadmap to HTC Workload Submission
====================================



# Overview

This guide lays out the steps needed to go from logging in to an OSG Access Point to running a full scale high throughput computing 
(HTC) workload on OSG's [Open Science Pool (OSPool)](https://opensciencegrid.org/about/open_science_pool/). 
The steps listed here apply to any new workload 
submission, whether you are a long-time OSG user or just getting 
started with your first workload, with helpful links to our documentation pages. 

This guide assumes that you have applied for an OSG Access Point account and 
have been approved after meeting with an OSG Research Computing Facilitator. 
If you don't yet have an account, you can apply for one at <https://portal.osg-htc.org/application>
or [contact us](mailto:support@osg-htc.org) with any questions you have. 

Learning how to get started on the OSG does not need to end with this document or 
our guides! Learn about our training opportunities and personal facilitation support 
in the [Getting Help](#getting-help) section below. 

# 1. Introduction to the OSPool and OSG Resources

The OSG's Open Science Pool is best-suited for computing work that can be run as many, independent 
tasks, in an approach called "high throughput computing." For more information 
on what kind of work is a good fit for the OSG, 
see [Is the Open Science Pool for You?](../../../overview/account_setup/is-it-for-you/). 

Learn more about the services provided by the OSG that can support your HTC workload:

# 2. Log on to an OSG Access Point

If you have not done so, apply for an account at <https://portal.osg-htc.org/application>. A Research Computing Facilitator will contact you within one business day to arrange a meeting to discuss your computational goals and to activate your account. 

Users with accounts created starting in Spring 2023 have their accounts managed through a new account management service. To learn how to login to your account, visit: [Join and Log In to uw.osg-htc.org Access Points](../../../overview/account_setup/ap7-access/)

Historically, OSG accounts were created and managed through a service called OSG Connect. If you are unsure if you have an account on this service, contact a [Research Computing Facilitator](mailto:support@osg-htc.org), who will provide you with your account details. If your account was created through OSG Connect, visit the following guide to learn how to access OSPool resources: [Join and Log In to OSG Connect Access Points](../../../overview/account_setup/connect-access/)

# 3. Learn to Submit HTCondor Jobs

Computational work is run on the OSPool by submitting it as “jobs” to the
HTCondor scheduler. Jobs submitted to HTCondor are then scheduled and
run on different resources that are part of the Open Science Pool.
Before submitting your own computational work, it is important to
understand how HTCondor job submission works. The following guides show
how to submit basic HTCondor jobs. The second example allows you to see
where in the OSPool your jobs run. 

- [Quickstart](../../../htc_workloads/submitting_workloads/tutorial-quickstart/)
- [Finding OSG Locations](../../../htc_workloads/submitting_workloads/tutorial-osg-locations/)

# 4. Test a First Job

After learning about the basics of HTCondor job submission, you will
need to generate your own HTCondor job -- including the software needed
by the job and the appropriate mechanism to handle the data. We
recommend doing this using a single test job. 

## Prepare your software

Software is an integral part of your HTC workflow.  Whether you’ve written it yourself, inherited it from your research group, or use common open-source packages, any required executables and libraries will need to be made available to your jobs if they are to run on the OSPool. 

Read through [this overview of Using Software](../../../htc_workloads/using_software/software-overview/) to help you determine the best way to provide your software.  We also have the following guides/tutorials for each major software portability approach:

- To **install your own software**, begin with the guide on [Compiling Software](../../../htc_workloads/using_software/compiling-applications/) and then complete the [Example Software Compilation tutorial](../../../htc_workloads/using_software/example-compilation/).
- To **use precompiled binaries**, try the example presented in the [AutoDock Vina tutorial](../../../software_examples/drug_discovery/tutorial-AutoDockVina/) and/or the [Julia tutorial](../../../software_examples/other_languages_tools/julia-on-osg/).
- To **use Docker containers** for your jobs, start with the [Docker and Singularity Containers guide](../../../htc_workloads/using_software/available-containers-list/), and (optionally) work through the [Tensorflow tutorial](../../../software_examples/machine_learning/tutorial-tensorflow-containers/) (which uses Docker/Singularity)

Finally, here are some additional guides specific to some of the most common scripting languages and software tools used on OSG\*\*:

- [Python](../../../software_examples/python/manage-python-packages/)
- [R](../../../software_examples/r/tutorial-R/)
- [Machine Learning](../../../software_examples/machine_learning/tutorial-tensorflow-containers/)
- [BLAST](../../../software_examples/bioinformatics/tutorial-blast-split/)

\*\*This is not a complete list.  Feel free to search for your software in our [Knowledge base](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/). 

## Manage your data

The data for your jobs will need to be transferred to each job that runs in the OSPool, 
and HTCondor has built-in features for getting data to jobs. Our [Data Management Policies](../../../htc_workloads/managing_data/osgconnect-storage/) guide
discussed the relevant approaches, when to use them, and where to stage data for each.

## Assign the Appropriate Job Duration Category

Jobs running in the OSPool may be interrupted at any time, and will be re-run by HTCondor, unless a single execution of a job exceeds the allowed duration. Jobs expected to take longer than 10 hours will need to identify themselves as 'Long' according to our [Job Duration policies](../../../htc_workloads/workload_planning/jobdurationcategory/). Remember that jobs expected to take longer than 20 hours are not a good fit for the OSPool (see [Is the Open Science Pool for You?](../../../overview/account_setup/is-it-for-you/)) without implementing self-checkpointing (further below).

# 5. Scale Up

After you have a sample job running successfully, you’ll want to scale
up in one or two steps (first run several jobs, before running ALL of them). 
HTCondor has many useful features that make it easy to submit
multiple jobs with the same submit file.  

- [Easily submit multiple jobs](../../../htc_workloads/submitting_workloads/submit-multiple-jobs/)
- [Scaling up after success with test jobs](../../../htc_workloads/workload_planning/preparing-to-scale-up/) discusses how to test your jobs for duration, memory and disk usage, and the total amount of space you might need on the 

<!-- TODO: Making jobs resilient* -->

# 6. Special Use Cases
