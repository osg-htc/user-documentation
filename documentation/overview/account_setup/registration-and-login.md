## Start Here: Overview of Requesting OSPool Access

The major steps to get started on the OSPool are: 

* apply for access to the OSPool
* meet with a facilitation team member for an short consultation and orientation. 
* register for a specific OSPool Access Point
* log in to your designated Access Point

Each of these is detailed in the guide below. 
Once you've gone through these steps, you should be able to begin running work! 

## Apply for OSPool Access

To start, fill out the interest form on this OSG Portal site: 

[OSPool Consultation Request](https://portal.osg-htc.org/application)

This will send the Research Facilitation team an email. We will be in 
touch to set up an orientation meeting, and confirm if you are joining 
an existing project on the OSPool or starting a new one. 

## Orientation Meeting

The orientation meeting generally takes about 20-30 minutes and is a chance to 
talk about your work, how it will 
fit on the OSPool, and some practical next steps for getting started. 

## Register for an Access Point

for an account on a specific OSPool Access Point. The current default are
