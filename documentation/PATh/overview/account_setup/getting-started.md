# Getting Started on the PATh Facility

The PATh Facility is part of a pilot project funded by the NSF Office of Advanced 
Cyberinfrastructure. NSF-funded researchers can apply to request credits for the PATh
facility. The facility aims to demonstrate the value of dedicated, distributed resources
to the NSF Science and Engineering community.

Composed of current gen hardware, consisting of 30,000 cores and 36 A100 GPUs the PATh facility is built to 
run your high throughput computing workloads. Managed by the HTCondor Suite's Access Point the PATh facility is 
managed to make running these workloads easy.

## 1. Set up a Consultation 

The PATh team is here to help! As part of the consulting services offered to any researcher, our team can help you 
decompose your workload to ensembles of jobs and generate resource estimates for the various tasks in the ensemble. 

Interested Investigators are encouraged to reach out the PATh support staff at 
[credit-accounts@path-cc.io](credit-accounts@path-cc.io) with questions regarding PATh resources, 
using HTC or estimating credit needs.

## 2. Submit Credit Request

The opportunity to use PATh Facility resources is available to all PIs submitting, or having submitted, proposals to the
following Programs as per the [Dear Colleagues Letter](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22051/nsf22051.jsp):

## 3. Provide PATh with User Information

To help use manage the users of the PATh facility we require that all PI's awarded with credits complete a 
quick account details form. After completion of this form PATh support will contact you to set up your credit accounts.

## 4. Registering and Logging into PATh Facility Account

Now that you have credits, and have met with our facilitation staff, you are ready to start using your allocation. Follow
our [Registration and Login Guide](../../overview/account_setup/registration/) to access your account and start running
your workloads!
