Email, Office Hours, and 1-1 Meetings 
====================================
 

*There are multiple ways to get help from PATh’s Research Computing Facilitators. Get in touch anytime!*


## Research Computing Facilitators

To help researchers effectively utilize computing resources, our
Research Computing Facilitators (RCFs) not only assist you in
implementing your computational work on PATh compute resources, but can
also point you to other services related to research computing and data
needs. For example, RCFs can:

- Assist with planning your computational approach for a research problem
- Teach you to submit jobs via the OSG Connect service
- Help you with troubleshooting on OSG systems
- Connect you with other researchers using similar software or methods
- Point to learning materials for programming and software development
- Help you identify applicable non-OSG data storage options
- Find someone who knows the answer to your question, even if the RCF doesn’t
- … and other helpful activities to facilitate your use of cyberinfrastructure


## Help via Email

We provide ongoing support via email to support@osg-htc.org, and it’s
never a bad idea to start by sending questions or issues via email. You
can typically expect a first response within a few business hours.
